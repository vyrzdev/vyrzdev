Hi! I'm Ben, a full stack backend and web developer.
I predominantly use Rust for my projects, however I was originally a Python/JS developer.

Some of my passions are byte-level file parsing, networking/packet design, and competing-consumers-style pipelines.

A few things I have worked with are...

- Rust
  - Axum (Web framework)
  - Proj4rs (pure rust reimplementation of proj4)
  - Serde (Serialisation/Deserialization Library)
  - Tokio (Async Runtime, for multithreading and data-flow)
  - Tracing (Logging library)

- Python
    - FastAPI
    - Flask
    - Asyncio
    - Mongoengine & SQLAlchemy
    - Py-Serde (A lib for structuring and safely parsing JSON)
      ^ Contributed.
    - Pika @ RabbitMQ for AMQP
  
- Javascript
  - Typescript
  - UI Frameworks (React, Svelte, Vue3)
  - jQuery (creating dynamic effects that are tedious in DOM api)
  - Node w/ Vite on Electron

- Markup/Config Languages
  - JSON, TOML, YAML
  - HTML, CSS, SCSS

- APIs:
    - Square, Etsy, Shopify, Ebay, WooCommerce
    - Wordpress
    - Google (Sheets & Docs)
    - Plesk
    - Google Cloud Platform

- Systems Administration
  - GCP App Engine / Compute Engine
  - Docker + Docker Compose
  - Linux (Arch, Fedora, Ubuntu)
  - Networking & Configuration (iwd, network-manager, wpa_supplicant)
  - Plesk & CPanel


Since attending university, I have also completed the following modules.

- 1st Year
  - Computing Foundations (Databasing with SQL)
  - Computing Systems (Sigma16 Assembly & Basic Logic)
  - Electronics Engineering 1X + 1Y (MBED Microcontroller Programming, RC Filters, OpAmps)
  - Maths 1G+1C (Calculus, Matrices, and Linear Algebra)
- 2nd Year
  - Algorithmic Foundations (Discrete Mathematics & Probability)
  - Networks & Operating Systems (CPU Architecture, Protocol specifics, OSI Model)
  - Digital Electronics (VHDL, Programming FPGAs, Interpreting data-sheets)
  - Electrical Circuits (Transient Analysis by hand, Sinusoidal representation of AC signals, Solving for Phase/Impedance)
  - Intro to Object Oriented Programming (Java Programming)
  - Electronic Design Project (Team project, design and build, and report on an electronic heart rate monitor using [PPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoplethysmogram))
  - Algorithms & Data Structures
  - Analogue Electronics
  - Object Oriented Software Engineering (Java Design Patterns, Project Managament)
  - Embedded Processors (Microcontroller Programming)
  - Physics 2T, Programming under Linux (Covers basic C development & toolchain)
- 3rd Year
  - Completed:
    - Algorithmics 1 (Regex, Finite State Automata, NP Completeness/Computability)
    - Human Computer System Design (Ergonomics, Usability, and Formal Study Methods)
  - IN PROGRESS:
    - Database Systems - (SQL, Normalisation, Optimisation, and analytics)
    - Professional Software Development - (Team/Project Management Techniques)
    - Cyber Security Fundamentals - (Basic Cryptography, Formalisation of Security, Real-World Concerns)
    - Programming Languages (Representing Contextual Grammars (EBNF), Abstract Syntax Trees, Compilers (extend one!))
    - Data Fundamentals - (Tensors, Optimisation Problems, Numpy, Matplotlib)
    - Networked Systems - (TCP/UDP/QUIC, real world concerns, Congestion Control/Slow-Start)
    - Systems Programming - (C, Pointers & Memory Access, Manual Allocation, implemented various ADTs in C)
    - Team Project - (Design and implement a REAL PRODUCT for a REAL CUSTOMER in teams of 5, randomly selected)
      - Working for THALES UK, to produce GeoQuery, a tool which takes a directory full of map files, and allows
        this directory to be searched by a region, to find all files which contain data about the query region.
      - Along the way I have improved my proficiency in Rust, and become comfortable with Axum, Tokio, and Serde.
      - I have also gained proficiency in React, as well as frontend development as a whole.
      - Working with my team has been a pleasure, our current implementation meets all the initial requirements and then some.
